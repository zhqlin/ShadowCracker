				ShadowCracker by:noosh

Python Script that takes in a shadow file and tries to crack username with use of wordlist

				Usage

In order for the program to work you need to download/create a wordlist and place it in the same directory as the script. Rename the 
dictionary to "dictionary". (In the real world you would provide a wordlist to use, but those were not the specificications by my client)


./ShadowCracker.py [shadowFile] [username]



You must have the same level of permissions as the shadow file. For example if shadow file is owned by root and can only be read by root, 
you need to be root user.

				Enjoy!!
